## Combined-ILC-MPC
**This is a repository of the codes for combined design of ILC and MPC [1] for nonlinear systems.**


### Required software/toolboxes for MATLAB
The following software/toolboxes for **MATLAB** are required for using the codes in this folder:
 1. Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3: https://www.mpt3.org/;
 2. YALMIP: https://yalmip.github.io/;
 3. MOSEK(Version 9.3.6): https://www.mosek.com/;

Note that you can readily adapt these codes to your model after installing the software/toolboxes above.
